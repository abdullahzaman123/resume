    <p>MY NAME IS ABDULLHA ZAMAN
        ‚úÖ Freelancer on Upwork, specializing in üöÄhigh-performanceüöÄ Nextjs / React sites, GraphQL, MongoDB, html, css, and Postgres backends, mobile development with React Native, and secure smart contracts with Solidity. I'm the perfect all-in-one package for creating any site, service, or product. Being a freelancer and content writer, I'm constantly keeping up with the latest tech and best practices.
        I am proficient in;
        - Developing unique and complex React-Vue-Angular applications.
        - Implementing fully responsive designs with a wide array of frameworks, including TailwindCSS, Chakra UI, and Sass.
        - Creating high-performing static and SSR sites using Gatsby, Blitz, and Remix.
        - Creating and managing databases and APIs using MongoDB and Prisma/GraphQL.
        - Unit, Integration, and End-to-End Testing using Jest, Cypress, and Vitest.
        - Optimizing site accessibility, SEO, and performance using Lighthouse.
        
        If you work with me, what'll you get?
        - 24/7 Communication; I work from home, which means I'm always online and in touch.
        - Test-Driven Development; I strive to write clean, well documented, and stable applications that your future developers will find easy to get started with.
        - Continuous Deployment; During the development stage you'll be given a link to your live, but private, site that you will be able to view as you like and see your site grow to life!
        - Deployment and Hosting; Don't want to worry about keeping your site up to date? I've got you covered and can help manage and maintain your site long-term.
        
        Got something interesting? Message me and let's see what we can build together (~Àò‚ñæÀò)~.
        
        Note: I don't do anything with WordPress besides using it as a headless CMS, if that's what you want there are many much better options out there anyway ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.</p>
